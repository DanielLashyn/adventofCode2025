# adventofCode2025

Will be doing the Advent of code challenges for 2025. This year will be doing the challenge in python with the added challenge of increasing my skills in object oriented programming. Because of that each Day has the following constraints:

1) The data from the questions must be contained in a custom class. 
2) Each question must have atleast one custom class script
3) Each class must be contained within it's '.py' file (ie class santa and elvesmust be in santa.py and elves.py respectively)
4) The main.py script must be able to handle the regular and advance versions of the questions.


## File Structure:
Below is how the file structure for this project

`master.py` is the master script to run any of the main.py scripts.
`main.py` is the pyton script to abtain obtain the solutions for that day.
